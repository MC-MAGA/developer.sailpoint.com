# BuildMap Rule

## Overview

This rule manipulates raw input data provided by the rows and columns in a file and builds a map from the incoming data. Use this rule to create a new value by combining two columns together. For example, if one column was `access` and another `permissions` you could combine these together to create an entitlement `admin-read`.

:::info 

This rule runs in the cloud, but it's really a connector rule because it executes against the DelimitedFileConnector. 

:::

## Execution

- **Cloud Execution** - This rule executes in the Identity Security Cloud cloud, and has read-only access to the records from the Delimited File being imported. However, it doesn't have access to on-premise sources or connectors.
- **Logging** - Logging statements are currently only visible to SailPoint personnel.
