## Overview

The SailPoint Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server enables seamless integration between GenAI applications like Claude Desktop and n8n, and SailPoint Identity Security Cloud. Through natural language interactions, users can:

* Search for requestable items (roles, entitlements, access profiles) using natural language (English or not)
* Create access requests through guided AI interactions
* Query request status using natural language
* Cancel pending requests when needed

SailPoint MCP Server enables a fundamental shift in how users interact with identity and access management systemsâ€”moving from complex UIs to intuitive, AI-powered conversations.

Refer to the official [Model Context Protocol (MCP) documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) to learn more about MCP.
