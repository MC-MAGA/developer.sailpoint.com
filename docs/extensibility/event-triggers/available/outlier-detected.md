## Event Context

The 'Outlier Detected' event trigger notifies subscribed applications of any identities that have unusual access when compared to their peers. Outliers are calculated daily, and any identities that are flagged as outliers will be sent to subscribers of the trigger.

This is an example input from this trigger:

```json
{
  "identity": {
    "id": "ee769173319b41d19ccec6cea52f237b",
    "displayName": "John Doe",
    "type": "IDENTITY"
  },
  "outlierType": "LOW_SIMILARITY",
  "score": 0.82
}
```

- `outlierType` - Only `LOW_SIMILARITY` is supported at this time.
- `score` - The range is `0.0` to `1.0`. The higher the score, the more likely the identity is an outlier.
