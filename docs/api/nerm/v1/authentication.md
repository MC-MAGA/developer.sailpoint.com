## Overview

NERM uses bearer tokens to allow customers to authenticate to NERM API endpoints. These tokens can be generated by following the instructions [here](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/ne-admin/help/setup/api.html).

## Example

To use your bearer token simply provide it in the header with the request like so: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
