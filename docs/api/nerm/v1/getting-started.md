## Find Your Tenant Name

Before you can make API calls, you must identify what tenant and url you should use to make your calls. The url used is the same as the url for your browser client. For example, if you log in to `https://mycompany.nonemployee.com`, then you will make your API calls to `https://mycompany.nonemployee.com/api/<resource>`

## Generate a Token

To authenticate you will need to generate a token. That can be done by following the instructions here: [Generating a New API Key](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/ne-admin/help/setup/api.html). Once you have your token, you are ready to start making calls!

## API Tools

There are several API tools that make exploring and testing APIs easier than using the command line or a programming language. One tool is [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). SailPoint provides an official Postman workspace where our collections are always up to date with the latest API changes. NERM endpoints will be added soon, so be sure to check back often.
