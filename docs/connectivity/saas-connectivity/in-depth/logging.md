## Printing Logs with the CLI

Fetch logs from ISC by issuing the `sail conn logs` command:

```bash
$ sail conn logs

```

To tail the logs to see output as it happens, execute the `sail conn logs tail` command.

It can also be helpful to execute the logs command along with grep to filter your results to a specific connector or text:

```bash
$ sail conn logs | grep 'connector version 29'
[2022-07-14T11:04:24.442-04:00] INFO  | invokeCommand    â–¶ï¸Ž Command execution started : std:test-connection, for connector version 29.
```

## Logging with console.log

anywhere that you use console.log in your code will expose the output to the logs. The following example has a printed statement in the index.ts file:

```javascript
// Connector must be exported as module property named connector
export const connector = async () => {

...
    // Use the vendor SDK, or implement own client as necessary, to initialize a client
    const airtable = new AirtableClient(config)
    return createConnector()
        .stdTestConnection(async (context: Context, input: undefined, res: Response<StdTestConnectionOutput>) => {
            // print the output to the console
            console.log('testing connector logging')
            res.send(await airtable.testConnection())
        })

...

```

When you run the `sail conn logs` command, you will see the following in the output:

```bash
$ sail conn logs tail

[2022-07-14T11:23:05.418-04:00] INFO  | connectorMessage â–¶ï¸Ž {"commandType":"std:test-connection","invocationId":"e5c73502-2c03-4b22-aa0d-5b67655e8f2d","message":"testing connector logging\n","requestId":"93370aa663d94bebb509bf5661f18650","version":9}
[2022-07-14T11:23:06.085-04:00] INFO  | commandOutcome   â–¶ï¸Ž {"commandType":"std:test-connection","completed":true,"elapsed":1071,"message":"command completed","requestId":"93370aa663d94bebb509bf5661f18650","version":9}
```

## Logging using the SDK

Use the built in logging tool to simplify the logging process and enhance your loggerâ€™s capabilities. To start, import the logger from the sdk:

`import { logger as SDKLogger } from '@sailpoint/connector-sdk'`

Next, add a simple configuration for the logger to use throughout your application.

[logger.ts](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/airtable-example-connector/blob/main/src/logger/logger.ts)

```javascript
import {logger as SDKLogger} from '@sailpoint/connector-sdk';

export const logger = SDKLogger.child(
  // specify your connector name
  {connectorName: 'Airtable'},
);
```

Now you can import your logger into your project and start logging.

[index.ts](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/airtable-example-connector/blob/main/src/index.ts)

```javascript
// Connector must be exported as module property named connector
export const connector = async () => {

...
    // Use the vendor SDK, or implement own client as necessary, to initialize a client
    const airtable = new AirtableClient(config)
    return createConnector()
        .stdAccountList(async (context: Context, input: undefined, res: Response<StdAccountListOutput>) => {
            const accounts = await airtable.getAllAccounts()

            // use the logger to send accounts that are fetched
            logger.info(accounts, "fetched the following accounts from Airtable")
            for (const account of accounts) {
                res.send(account.toStdAccountListOutput())
            }
        })

...

```

## Configuring the SDK to Mask Sensitive Values

The SDK Logger uses [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) under the hood, which has the built-in capability to search and remove JSON paths that can contain sensitive information.

> ðŸš§ Never expose any Personal Identifiable Information in any logging operations.

Start by looking at line 116 to 122 in your logger configuration, which looks like the one below:

```javascript
import {logger as SDKLogger} from '@sailpoint/connector-sdk';

export const logger = SDKLogger.child(
  // specify your connector name
  {connectorName: 'Airtable'},
  // This is optional for  removing specific information you might not want to be logged
  {
    redact: {
      paths: [
        '*.password',
        '*.username',
        '*.email',
        '*.id',
        '*.firstName',
        '*.lastName',
        '*.displayName',
      ],
      censor: '****',
    },
  },
);
```

Now compare that with the object you want to remove information from while still logging information in it:

[AirtableAccount.ts](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/airtable-example-connector/blob/main/src/models/AirtableAccount.ts)

```javascript
export class AirtableAccount {
    airtableId!: string
    displayName!: string
    email!: string
    id!: string
    department!: string
    firstName!: string
    lastName!: string
    enabled = true
    locked = false
    password!: string
    entitlments!: Array<string>
}
```

Now when you log the contents of an `AirtableAccount` object, you will see all the fields redacted. For example, in [index.ts](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/airtable-example-connector/blob/main/src/index.ts) we log the `accounts` in the following code snippet:

```javascript
.stdAccountList(async (context: Context, input: undefined, res: Response<StdAccountListOutput>) => {
    const accounts = await airtable.getAllAccounts()

    logger.info(accounts, "fetched the following accounts from Airtable")
    for (const account of accounts) {
        res.send(account.toStdAccountListOutput())
    }
})
```

which results in the following log output:

```bash
$ sail conn logs

[2022-07-14T11:19:29.368-04:00] INFO  | invokeCommand    â–¶ï¸Ž Command invocation complete : std:account:list, for connector version: 8. Elapsed time 111.836542ms

[2022-07-14T11:19:30.678-04:00] INFO  | commandOutcome   â–¶ï¸Ž {"commandType":"std:account:list","completed":true,"elapsed":1290,"message":"command completed","requestId":"379a8a4510944daf9d02b51a29ae863e","version":8}
```

You can see that any of the PII information has now been transformed into "\*\*\*\*"
