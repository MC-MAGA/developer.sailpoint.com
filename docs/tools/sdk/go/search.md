To try using the ISC [search functionality](/docs/api/v3/search-post) along with pagination, copy this code into your "sdk.go" file, following the main code:

```go
func getSearchResults(ctx context.Context, apiClient *sailpoint.APIClient) {
 search := v3.NewSearchWithDefaults()
 search.Indices = append(search.Indices, "identities")
 searchString := []byte(`
 {
 "indices": [
  "identities"
 ],
 "query": {
  "query": "*"
 },
    "sort": [
        "-name"
    ]
 }
   `)
 search.UnmarshalJSON(searchString)
 resp, r, err := sailpoint.PaginateSearchAPI(ctx, apiClient, *search, 0, 10, 10000)
 if err != nil {
  fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Error when calling `PaginateSearchApi``: %v\n", err)
  fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Full HTTP response: %v\n", r)
 }
 // response from `search`
 for i := 0; i < len(resp); i++ {
  fmt.Println(resp[i]["name"])
 }
}
```

To run the search, run this command: `go run sdk.go` This example lists all the identities it finds in your tenant.

There are two ways to configure the search:

1. You can edit the `searchString` JSON:

```go showLineNumbers
 searchString := []byte(`
 {
 "indices": [
  "identities"
 ],
 "query": {
  "query": "*"
 },
    "sort": [
        "-name"
    ]
 }
   `)
```

In this example, changing the `"indices"` on line 3 from `"identities"` to `"access profiles"` makes the search return access profiles instead of identities.

2. You can edit the string at the end of this `search.Indices` line to do the same thing as a shortcut:

```go
search.Indices = append(search.Indices, "identities")
```

In this example, the `"identities"` string represents an unmarshalled JSON. Changing `append(search.Indices, "identities")` to `append(search.Indices, "access profiles")` does the same thing that editing the `searchString` JSON does.

### Paginate search results

The search example includes the syntax you can use to paginate search results. Edit this line to configure the search result pagination:

```go
resp, r, err := sailpoint.PaginateSearchAPI(ctx, apiClient, *search, 0, 10, 10000)
```

The first value refers to the `initialOffset`, the starting number for the results, the second refers to the `increment`, the number of records per page, and the third refers to the `limit`, the last record that can be returned.

For example, changing the first number to `21`, the second to `20`, and the third to `40` would configure the search to return records 21 to 40 and then stop.
